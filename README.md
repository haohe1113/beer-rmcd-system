## Introduction  
[Beeradvocate.com](https://www.beeradvocate.com/) is an online beer rating webstie. Alongside the ratings, people also post their reviews about the experience with various beers. In this project, we scraped beer reviews from Beeradvocate.com and used them to build a beer recommendation system with various text mining concepts. The recommendation system was required to accept user inputs about desired attributes of a product and come up with 3 recommendations.
